# Example of how to use Robot Framework to generate JUnit result file

Small project to show how to make Robot Framework to generate the JUnit result file that you can [`POST /automations/executions/junit`](https://support.smartbear.com/zephyr-scale-cloud/api-docs/#operation/createJUnitExecutions)

### Configuration

You just have to execute Robot Framework with `-x` parameter followed by the xml result file name to instruct it to generate the JUnit result file. Here is an example:

```
robot -x junitresult.xml mytest.robot
```

This will execute `mytest.robot` test file and generate the JUnit result file `junitresult.xml` that you'll [`POST /automations/executions/junit`](https://support.smartbear.com/zephyr-scale-cloud/api-docs/#operation/createJUnitExecutions).


### Naming conventions

There are 2 ways to match Robot Framework test cases with Zephyr Scale test cases:
- **By Zephyr Scale test case key**: in case your Robot framework test case contains the Zephyr Scale test case key
- **By Zephyr Scale test case name**: if your Robot Framework test case doesn't contain some Zephyr Scale test case key, then it will try to match Zephyr Scale test case by name following the pattern `<robot filename with no extension>.<robot test case name>` 

Here is an example. Consider a file named `calculator.robot`:
```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
# will match Zephyr Scale test case named Calculator.User can clear the display
User can clear the display
    Input number    10
    Press operator    +
    Input number    1
    Press clear 
    Display should be empty

*** Test Cases ***
# will match Zephyr Scale test case with key NET-T1743
NET-T1744 User can calculate with wrong result 
    Input number    1
    Press operator    +
    Input number    1
    Press enter 
    Result should be     3

*** Test Cases ***
# will match Zephyr Scale test case with key NET-T1744
User can calculate two numbers - NET-T1744
    [Template]    Calculate two numbers should pass
    10    +    5    15
    10    -    5    5
    10    /    5    2
    10    *    5    50
```
As we can see, the first Robot Framework test cases will match Zephyr Scale test cases by name and the last 2 will match by key.

### Requirements to run this example project

In order to execute this example on your local machine youâ€™ll have to checkout this repository and install python 3. Here is how you can do it on mac:

```
brew upgrade pyenv
pyenv install 3.6.0
pyenv global 3.6.0
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you have to install robot framework and docutils library:

```
pip install robotframework
pip install docutils
```

You can now make Robot Framework to generate the JUnit result file by executing the following command:

```
robot -x junitresult.xml calculator.robot
```
