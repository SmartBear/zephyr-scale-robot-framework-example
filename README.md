# Example of how to use Robot Framework to generate JUnit result file

Small project to show how to make Robot Framework to generate the JUnit result file that you can [`POST /automations/executions/junit`](https://support.smartbear.com/zephyr-scale-cloud/api-docs/#operation/createJUnitExecutions)

### How to generate the JUnit result files

You just have to execute Robot Framework with `-x` parameter followed by the xml result file name to instruct it to generate the JUnit result file. Here is an example:

```
robot -x junitresult.xml mytest.robot
```

This will execute `mytest.robot` test file and generate the JUnit result file `junitresult.xml` that you'll [`POST /automations/executions/junit`](https://support.smartbear.com/zephyr-scale-cloud/api-docs/#operation/createJUnitExecutions).


### Requirements to run this example project

In order to execute this example on your local machine youâ€™ll have to checkout this repository and install python 3. Here is how you can do it on mac:

```
brew upgrade pyenv
pyenv install 3.6.0
pyenv global 3.6.0
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you have to install robot framework and docutils library:

```
pip install robotframework
pip install docutils
```

You can now make Robot Framework to generate the JUnit result file by executing the following command:

```
robot -x junitresult.xml calculator.robot
```
